Task 1 : Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Dataset 
This Jupyter Notebook performs data analysis on a retail dataset. It involves importing essential Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization. The dataset includes sales transactions with fields such as Invoice, StockCode, Description, Quantity, and more. The notebook likely explores patterns in product sales, visual trends, and possibly customer behavior based on the data.

Task 2 : Customer Segmentation using Clustering 
This Jupyter Notebook performs customer segmentation using clustering techniques, specifically the K-Means algorithm. It uses the Mall_Customers.csv dataset, which includes customer attributes like Age, Income, and Spending Score. The notebook utilizes Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn to visualize customer distribution and apply clustering for identifying distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior.

Task 4 : Power BI Dashboard Development 
Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard – Monthly Overview (Feb 2024)
This interactive dashboard provides key performance metrics for the hospital emergency room during February 2024. It includes:
(i)Total Patients Treated: 431
(ii)Average Wait Time: 36.7 minutes
(iii)Patient Satisfaction Score: 4.72
(iv)Referrals Made: 179
(v)Admission Status: 52% Admitted, 48% Not Admitted
(vi)Timely Service: 66% of patients seen within 30 minutes
(vii)Patient Demographics:
(viii)Age Group: Highest numbers in age groups 30–39 and 70–79
(ix)Gender: 54% Female, 45% Male
(x)Race: Most patients identified as White, African American, or Asian

Other insights include patient visit patterns by day and hour, department referrals (most common: General Practice), and raw patient-level details such as ID, admission timestamp, age, gender, race, and department referral.

Task 5 : Retail Sales Data Analysis
The Excel and SQL files together form the foundation of a Retail Sales Analysis project.
The Excel file contains transactional sales data, including customer details, product categories, quantities, pricing, and total sales.
The SQL file defines the structure of a retail_sales table and includes basic data exploration queries (e.g., checking for missing values, counting records).
This setup enables importing the data into a database for further querying, cleaning, and analysis of retail sales trends and customer behavior.
